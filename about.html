            <h3>FOUNDED IN DUBAI IN 1997, IDEAL DESIGN HAS GROWN FROM A SMALL 
                SHOP TO A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING UNIT</h3>
                <p>We initially started out making retail displays and corporate gift items, using materials such as plastic sheets, 
                    aluminium extrusions and engineered wood. Over the years, the company has evolved into a high-end CNC sheet 
                    metal processing facility, providing turn-key solutions in the area of retail space, point-of-sale displays, and 
                    engineering services. The facility is well supported by integrating the right people with the right processes all under 
                    one roof. Today we continue to innovate using new age materials, tools and techniques to generate smart products 
                    and solutions in-line with the latest market trends and technology</p>
